# IntelliJ IDEA

It just works.

_IntelliJ IDEA_ (as other Jetbrains products) is a smart IDE that understands
most of your project automatically so you don't lose time in configuration. It
has many well integrated tools (embedded terminal, version control, ...) and
offers powerful refactoring capabilities.
