# Terminal

Some steps require you to use the terminal. Here is a quick reminder about how to access the terminal.

Terminal commands will be displayed as follow:

````
path $ command --options
````

`path` indicates the path of the current directory, you do not have to type it. When the path is not explicitly defined, it is assumed to be any path or the project root according to the context.
`$` indicates the command prompt, you do not have to type it either.

### Windows

You can open a terminal in any directory from the `shift + right click` context menu (`Open command window here`).

When adding variables to the `PATH`, you will have to open a new terminal in order get the updated value.

### Linux

Linux heavily relies on the terminal but if you're still unsure about how to access it, check your distribution's or desktop environment's help.
The usual shortcut to open a terminal is `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `T`.
