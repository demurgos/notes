# Gulp

_gulp_ is a task runner for Node.

## Installation

_gulp_ consists of a global command-line program (`gulp-cli`) to run tasks
and of an installation local to the project (`gulp`).

You only need to manually install `gulp-cli`, the local dependency is defined
in the project's `package.json` file so `npm install` will take care automatically
while installing all the dependencies.

### Dependencies

- [Node](./node.md)
- [npm](./npm.md)

### Installation

```shell
# Run as root
npm install --global gulp-cli
```

### Check the installation

```shell
# Run as a normal user
gulp --version
```
