# Notes

As the years and projects pass, I learn many things. I encountered a
wide range of tools and technologies, developed some opinions and
discovered various concepts. Unfortunately, most of this information is
spread dozens of projects, websites, configuration files, etc.
**This repository is an attempt at consolidating the various things I learned
and consider useful.**

Making a public repository lets me have it centralized and share it with
anyone interested: maybe you'll find something useful for you too.
