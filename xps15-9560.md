# Guide for Dell XPS 15 9560

I recently aquired a Dell XPS 15. This guide explains how to install
a Linux-only (no dual boot) on this laptop.

## Backup

Since it is a new computer, there is not much to backup.

Still, it has a Windows copy so I'd like to save the key.
To extract the Windows key, I use [ProduKey](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html). The download
links are at the bottom. Choose the zipped version, run it and it will display your key.

## Firmware configuration

Boot to Windows, then use `Shift` + `Click` on the Reboot button to
perform an advanced reboot. Choose a reboot to the firmware interface.

Configure the following options:

**POST Behavior | Extended BIOS POST Time**: Select 5 seconds instead of 0 seconds.
It should now display "F12: Boot options" when booting.


Apply and reboot. **MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN ENTER THE BIOS DIRECTLY**.
This will allow to revert any messed up configuration.

Plug your Arch Linux USB and return to the UEFI options.

**System configuration | SATA Operation**: Select **AHCI** instead of **RAID**.
It prevents compatibility issues with Linux and there is a single drive anyway.

**Secure boot | secure boot enable**: Disable secure boot

Boot sequence: Choose Arch USB first

Since you changed from AHCI to RAID, Windows will not be able to reboot. Fortunately you have
the post option so you can return to the BIOS menu and revert it if needed. It is just a failsafe.

Reboot. Since the Arch USB is still plugged and select as the first entry, you
should be able to boot to it.

## EFI Partition Backup

Since I do not master EFI, I prefer to make a full backup of the EFI partition, just in
case I mess up something.

Plug the USB drive for the backup and run `lsblk`:

```text
# lsblk
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
loop0         7:0    0 365.4M  1 loop /run/archiso/sfs/airootfs
sda           8:0    1  14.9G  0 disk /run/archiso/bootmnt
├─sda1        8:1    1   476M  0 part
└─sda2        8:2    1    64M  0 part
sdb           8:16   1  29.8G  0 disk
└─sdb1        8:17   1  29.8G  0 part
nvme0n1     259:0    0   477G  0 disk
├─nvme0n1p1 259:1    0   500M  0 part
├─nvme0n1p2 259:2    0   128M  0 part
├─nvme0n1p3 259:3    0 462.5G  0 part
├─nvme0n1p4 259:4    0   462M  0 part
├─nvme0n1p5 259:5    0  12.2G  0 part
└─nvme0n1p6 259:6    0   1.1G  0 part
```

Looks like the ArchISO USB is sda (mounted) and the backup is sdb.
The SSD drive is called nvme0n1.
From experience, I'd say that the first 500M partition is the EFI partition,
given the size the third partition is the Windows C: partition and the 5th partition
is the backup partition. The remaining ones might be over backup or buffer partitions.

Lets check!

```shell
# parted /dev/nvme0n1 print
Model: Unknown (unknown)
Disk /dev/nvme0n1: 512GB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: gpt
Disk Flags:

Warning: failed to translate partition name
Number  Start   End    Size    File system  Name                         Flags
 1      1049kB  525MB  524MB   fat32        EFI system partition         boot, esp
 2      525MB   660MB  134MB                Microsoft reserved partition msftres
 3      660MB   497GB  497GB   ntfs         Basic data partition         msftdata

 5      498GB   511GB  13.1GB  ntfs                                      hidden, diag
 6      511GB   512GB  1229MB  ntfs                                      hidden, diag
```

Looks like we were right. (You can run `fdisk -l` to get more info, the remaining
partitions are called "Windows recovery environment").

It's now time to mount both the EFI partition and the sdb1 partition to do the backup:

```shell
# mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/
# mkdir /mnt/efi/
# mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/efi/
# ls -Al /mnt/efi/
total 4
drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 4096 Nov 18 14:25 EFI
# cp -R /mnt/efi/ /mnt/efi.bak/
# ls -Al /mnt/efi.bak/
total 16
drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 16384 Mar  3 20:59 EFI
```

If you want you can mount the other partitions and do a full backup, I don't really feel that
I need it. It's pretty easy to install a fresh copy of Windows.

Once you're done:

```shell
umount /mnt/efi/
umount /mnt/
```

## Installation

From now on, follow the standard Arch Linux installation.

Here is my parted config:

```shell
Model: Unknown (unknown)
Disk /dev/nvme0n1: 512GB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: gpt
Disk Flags:

Number  Start   End     Size    File system    Name     Flags
 1      2097kB  539MB   524MB   fat32          efiboot  boot, esp
 2      539MB   4834MB  134MB   linux-swap(v1) swap
 3      4834MB  512GB   507GB   ext4           arch
```

I have no idea how to connect to wifi during the installation (required for pacstrap), I used the following adapter to get an Ethernet connection:
- [Cable Matters USB-C vers HDMI / VGA / Ethernet / VGA multiport Adaptateur (Thunderbolt 3 Port Compatible)](https://www.amazon.fr/Cable-Matters-Adaptateur-Thunderbolt-Compatible/dp/B01C316EIK/ref=sr_1_6)


Once you've rebooted, return to the EFI firmware

**Boot Sequence | Add Boot Option**

- Boot Option Name: `grub`
- File System list: default
- Path: `EFI\grub\grub.efi`

And apply the changes.
Reboot, it should start!

I had some warnings that seem to come from my Ethernet adapter, and another about `psmouse serio1`. We'll look at
it later, first you can finish the configuration.
